# Cat Clicker Premium Pro

This is my solution for Cat Clicker Premium Pro... the FINAL version of Cat-clicker, with every bell and whistle imaginable.

This code is expanded from Ben's work for Cat Clicker Premium from [Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).

Clone the repo and open up index.html to get started.

Select the 'Admin' button to edit cat names, images and # of clicks.
